\section{Tables and such}

Namelist input for LOFLI.
Note that none of the lines giving an array of values in the namelist that continues on the following line should have a comma at the end, for the other input lines this is optional. Several keywords may appear on a single line if separated by a comma. Anything after an exclamation mark (within the namelist) is treated as a comment. A complete list of namelist keywords is given in \tabref{LOFLI-namelist}.


\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption{Possible {\tt ParameterNames} in the {\tt \&Parameters} namelist of LOFLI (closed off with {\tt \&end}) and their default values.  All character following an exclamation sign `!' will be ignored on any input line.

   When calibrating this may be on or off, see \seclab{Calibration}.
\\  \verb!RealCorrelation! & =  .false. &
   At some point it would be nice to use the real part of the correlation function in stead of its Hilbert envelope, see \subref{RIAM}.
\\ \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Calibration} &
\\  \verb!Calibrations! & =  ---  &
   Specify the name of the user-made calibration file, see \secref{Scal}.
\\  \verb!Fit_AntOffset! & =  .false.  &  When set the delays for the individual antennas are searched for.
\\  \verb!WriteCalib! & =  .false.  &  Write the user-made calibration data to file.
\\ \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Antennas} &
\\  \verb!SignFlp_SAI! & =  ---  &  Single Antenna ID's of those where the polarity is wrong, see \secref{Explore}.
\\  \verb!PolFlp_SAI! & =  ---  & Single Antenna ID's of those where even-odd should be interchanged.

\\  \verb!FitRange_Samples! & =  ---  & total number of channels for which the cross correlations are calculated. The values for 'Safety', see SubRef{GCSA} is equated to this.
\\  \verb!AntennaRange! & =  100  &
Maximal distance, in [km], from the core for which the antennas are included in the analysis, see \secref{Scal}.
\\  \verb!CCShapeCut_lim! & =  0.6  &  Maximal value for the shape parameter, see \subref{RIAM}.
\\  \verb!ChiSq_lim! & =  50 &
Maximal value for the RMS$^2$ for sources to be written to file, see SubRef{SF}.
